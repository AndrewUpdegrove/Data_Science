All data was recorded for my cat Zuko.
One tablespoon of kibble was placed into a dish on the floor twice a day, once at dinner and breakfast time. These times were not purposefully set as some variance in the time was desirable to see if it changed his eating time too. 
The dry food Market Fresh Salmon & Chickenmeal was what was served to him.
