Human usage of natural resources is way beyond sustainable limits, and efforts directed towards more efficient and sustainable usage are insufficient and met with strong resistance. The cries of scientists worldwide are falling in deaf ears, because people, companies and governments are used to the temporary benefits that come with the current rate of production and consumption of goods.

Efforts towards improving human rights are being overburdened by spoiled people who demand unreasonable rights on grounds of ”gender identity” and other such ideology tailored to normalize their own sexual deviations, accusing those who disagree with such nonsense of bigotry and hate. Such a widespread rejection of biological reality and excessive sexual liberties will contribute to moral and social decadence. These groups are increasingly vocal and generate a lot of noise to become themselves a priority, in detriment of actually disadvantaged groups of people who need urgent help and remain ignored.

Eliminating poverty requires a coordinated effort which simply isn't happening, as there are rich and powerful people whose fortunes depend on cheap labor and maximizing profit. While uncontrolled capitalism increases economic inequality, socialism's promises are thwarted by corruption, repression and kleptocracy, leaving everyone but the top elites in the most abject poverty.

And humanity simply hasn't progressed beyond war, that's a sad fact."

I know that I'm an outlier with my beliefs and that may be the reason here, but it seemed like the questions were posed in such a way that the subject was inherently good. Specifically the wording of the gender equality one, although it is a complex issue and I will try not to push my views, it seems as though this is something that should be revered as a certain truth that it is, in all circumstances, a good thing. Essentially, it makes it seem like the subject is black and white, while the opinion is the only variable.
